# IFCAP

A secure, concurrent language with a simple type inference procedure
for an information flow and race-freedom analysis.

The inference procedure encodes lattice constraints from the IFC and
race-freedom analysis into the "effectively propositional" fragment of
first-order logic (a.k.a. the Bernays-Schonfinkel class). This FOL fragment
has a finite Herbrand universe and is decidable---nice!
